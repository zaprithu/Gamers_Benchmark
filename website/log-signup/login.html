- Programmer’s name: Tommy Lam, Ethan Dirkes, Chase Entwistle, Christopher Gronewold, Zonaid Prithu
- Date the code was created: Oct 27, 2024.
- Dates the code was revised:
    • Brief description of each revision & author:
        • Zonaid Prithu - November 24, 2024: Removed Login Button
- Preconditions:
• Acceptable Input:
    • Users must access this page using a compatible web browser that supports HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
    • Links should work as long as the referenced HTML files and images are correctly located within the specified directories.
- Unacceptable Input:
    • Any access attempt through a browser that doesn’t support basic HTML5 features may lead to display issues.
    • Missing resources (CSS, images, or linked HTML pages) will result in broken links or absent styles and images.
- Postconditions:
• Return Values or Types:
    • The page renders with a navigation bar, hero section, game links, and footer in a visual layout.
    • Displays appropriate images, navigation links, and button states (enabled/disabled) for each game.
- Error and exception condition values or types that can occur, and their meanings:
• Missing or broken links: If the linked HTML files or images don’t exist in the specified location, users will see errors (e.g., "404 Not Found") or broken images.
• Styling errors: If index.css is missing or contains errors, the page layout may appear unstyled or improperly formatted.
• JavaScript errors: Although minimal JavaScript is used, browser incompatibilities might prevent onclick events from functioning as intended.
- Side effects: Navigating to other linked pages within the website, such as leaderboard.html or game pages like maze.html.
- Invariants:
• The navigation bar and footer should always display correctly, providing consistency in user experience across the site.
• Game buttons set to btn-d (disabled class) will remain non-clickable until their pages are implemented and classes are updated to btn.
- Any known faults:
• Currently, some game buttons are disabled (btn-d class) and are placeholders until their pages are created.
